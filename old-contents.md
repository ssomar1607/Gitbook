Or you could visit ([https://special70.github.io/item%20config%20editors/executableitems\_editor.html](https://special70.github.io/item%20config%20editors/executableitems_editor.html)) where you can adjust the rates and have a button that evens out the rates across all of your commands. \
Just click the RANDOM RUN button in that website
