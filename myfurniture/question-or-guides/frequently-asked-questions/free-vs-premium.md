# Free vs Premium

The free version of MyFurniture is like a free-trial of it, to know how it works, what is possible and you could even make your whole server with it, but once you want to improve your items, and don't have all limitations the free one you have you start thinking into buying the premium version.. but, is it worth? what differences are there?&#x20;
