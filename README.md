Score has more than 100 custom commands, that normalyl were able to only run inside your EI/EB/EE, but now, they can be executed from anywhere, let's take a look how this works:

### Player commands

* Run a custom command from SCore for a specific player
  * /score run-player-command player:{playername} {command}

```
Example:
/score run-player-command player:Ssomar SENDMESSAGE &eHello
/score run-player-command player:Ssomar SENDMESSAGE &eHello player:Ssomar +++ DELAY 10 +++ SWING_MAIN_HAND
```

{% hint style="info" %}
It supports PAPI Placeholders
{% endhint %}

### Block commands

* Run a custom command from SCore for a specific block
  * /score run-block-command player:Ssomar block:{world},{x},{y},{z} {command}

### Entity commands

* Run a custom command from SCore for a specific entity
  * /score run-entity-command entity:{entityUUID} {command}
