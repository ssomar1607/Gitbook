# Special Behaviors

## Consumables

### Items being renewable whilst having usage

For example, if you created a snowball or a cookie, if you consume them in their usual vanilla ways, as long as the item's usage hasn't reached 0 usage, you can reuse them. They will only vanish from your inventory the moment the item's usage reaches 0.
