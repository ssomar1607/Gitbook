# More than 25 items bug ??

_Hey !! I installed the plugin a while ago, I have created like 6 items, when I try to add another one a message of error pops up saying_

REQUIRE PREMIUM: To add more than 25 items you need premium

_But I don't have more than 25 items !! I have only created 6._

**Well well, what happens here is that the amount of max items counts the defaults item, so what you can do is remove the default ones to gain more space to create your own items.**
