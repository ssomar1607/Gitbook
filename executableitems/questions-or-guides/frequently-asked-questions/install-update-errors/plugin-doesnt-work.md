# Plugin doesn't work 😡😡

If you think something is not working as intended, or there is a bug, and you already:

* 😀 Installed it correctly following the Installation procedure

{% content-ref url="how-to-install-correctly.md" %}
[how-to-install-correctly.md](how-to-install-correctly.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

* 📃 Checked the logs file to see if there is an error, and if there is an error checked the way to solve it in the wiki.

{% content-ref url="installation-errors-logs.md" %}
[installation-errors-logs.md](installation-errors-logs.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

* ✅ Downloaded and installed the last version of the plugin
* ⭐ And tested with only EI and Score to see if there is an incompatibility with other plugin



{% hint style="danger" %}
As much as possible, install the latest version of a major update\
Ex: instead of using 1.20, use 1.20.2
{% endhint %}
