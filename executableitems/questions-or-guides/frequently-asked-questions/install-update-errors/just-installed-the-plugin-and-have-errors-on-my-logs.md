# Just installed the plugin and have errors on my logs

Well well.. if the plugin is working don't get scared, all is fine, let's see what type of errors are these.

Generally people ask for help to fix this type of errors that comes with the **default items** and they can easily get fixed, but id you have another problem just ask in the discord support and we will add them into this list.

### ERROR COULDN'T LOAD THE WORLD VALUE

Some of the default items have world related configs that you could not have such as a world called "world", "world\_nether" and "world\_the\_end" (that is the case right now), if you have that problem just go to the item with Id: Prem\_World\_Teleporter on plugins/ExecutableItems/items/\<here>.yml and either remove the item itself or just disable that part of the config.
