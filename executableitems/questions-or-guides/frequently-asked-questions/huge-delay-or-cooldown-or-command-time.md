# HUGE delay | cooldown | command time

This page is to help you in case:

* You put a HUGE cooldown on your item
* You put a HUGE delay between your commands and now you need to wait like trillion of seconds for the next command to run
* You enabled a command and you now need a HUGE amount of time to wait that command to be disabled

And you would like to remove that HUGE amount of time, your only way is clearing your information on the plugin running **/ei clear** + **restart the server**
