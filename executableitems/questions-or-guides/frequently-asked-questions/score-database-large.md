# Score database large

If you are taking a look at the files of Score, and you see that Score database is quite large, don't mind, that is not a problem, and it won't depend on how many times do you have directly, it stores the delayed commands, cooldowns, and stuff like that.



Don't missunderstand, having more items means having a bigger database, but having many players too, anyways, the size of this file isn't a problem, so don't worry about this.
