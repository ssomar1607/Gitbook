# My EI written book doesn't work !!

If you created an EI with a written book and it look like this

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (267).png>)

its because the nbt wasn't imported correctly, to fix this you would need NBTAPI, once you have it, just redo the steps again, hold the item, type /ei create, and now it should work fine&#x20;
