# Custom crafting

Commonly we receive questions related to Custom Crafting, Â¿Does ExecutableItems supports it?, well, the answer first of all is that ExecutableItems doesn't have a mechanic inside of it related to CustomCrafting, so you should download another plugin to achieve this.

We suggest you to use -> [<mark style="color:blue;">**CustomCrafting | Advanced Custom Recipe Plugin \[1.16 - 1.19 | Free\]**</mark>](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/customcrafting-advanced-custom-recipe-plugin-1-16-1-19-free.55883/)



It needs a dependency, even though is not our plugin, many people have asked that it doesn't work, it works, it just need a dependency, if you take a look at the spigot page you can see this message, just click on "here"

So, bring to your server the plugin + dependency.
