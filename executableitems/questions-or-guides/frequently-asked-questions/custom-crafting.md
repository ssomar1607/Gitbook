# Custom crafting

Commonly we receive questions related to Custom Crafting, ¿Does Ssomar plugins supports it?, well, the answer first of all is that Ssomar plugins doesn't have a mechanic inside of it related to CustomCrafting, so you should download another plugin to achieve this.

We suggest you to use -> [<mark style="color:blue;">**CustomCrafting | Advanced Custom Recipe Plugin \[1.16 - 1.19 | Free\]**</mark>](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/customcrafting-advanced-custom-recipe-plugin-1-16-1-19-free.55883/) that works for many versions, but on the last version it stopped working as the title and review of the plugin says, If you know another plugin tell us so we can guide people to use another plugins.

## Discord

In case this didn't help you to achieve what you wanted or doesn't work for you, feel free to ask in the Discord of Ssomar plugins your question.
