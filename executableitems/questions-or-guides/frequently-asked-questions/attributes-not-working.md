# Attributes not working



{% embed url="https://youtu.be/VURkId4Li2A" %}

I created an EI with an item that normally has an attribute, for example, the netherite chestplate that has armor and armor toughness or the diamond sword that has speed attack and attack damage, but when I give myself this EI it doesn't have the attributes that should have.

Welp ! First of all that normally doesn't happen, try with NBTAI, and if still doesn't work would be weird, and your only last option would be to manually add those attributes.
