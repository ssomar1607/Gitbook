# How to duplicate an EI Item



{% embed url="https://youtu.be/P_WAW8l_bLc" %}

If you'd like to have another copy of your EI Item, for example, to create different classes of the same Item, such as \[Legendary], \[Epic], etc, and don't want to create each item from 0, just having a copy

* Create the first EI Item with /ei create and add all the stuff
* Once it is ready, and you want it to be the template for the another ones, go to plugins/ExecutableItems/items/\<here>.yml
* Search your item, and copy + paste, and change the id name for the id you want
* Then save everything and inside minecraft type /ei reload

Now you have the original item + the copy you created.
