# Per states texture

First of all, to better understanding this tutorial you must read first [<mark style="color:blue;">**General Items**</mark>](general-items.md) because I will suppose you already know some basic stuff of Texture pack, after telling this, let's begin.

## Commentary

* As I said, I'll suppose you know basic stuff, so, this tutorial will only focus on the bow or items with per states texture itself, I won't explain how to create a texture pack, where the items go, etc etc, just the state mechanic itself.

## Bow

### Texture

* First of all, if you pick up a vanilla bow and draw it you will see it has 4 states, so, we will need 4 textures. Let's do it (how to make the texture is explained in [<mark style="color:blue;">**General Items**</mark>](general-items.md))

* So we have the texture, now let's add it to the bow.

{% hint style="info" %}
I'll repeat, you have to know basic stuff of retexturing to know what I am talking about, this requires some experience before. I suggest you to read [<mark style="color:blue;">**General Items**</mark>](general-items.md) if you don't understand anything here.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember !

The parent handheld is the basic handheld when you hold an item like a diamond, if you want it to hold it normally like a bow you should use item/generated.

As it was said "it requires previous knowledge" -> and don't forget you can use this same tip to apply parents that don't belong here for example using as parent "item/shield"
{% endhint %}

### Let's test it

* After doing everything, save the jsons, save the texture in the correct folders, and give it to yourself in game + put the texture pack on.&#x20;

![We got 'em 😎😎](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (112).png>)

### Pulling states is working?

![It is 😎😎😎😎](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (219).png>)

* That's all, if have any question feel free to ask in the discord. Have a nice day

## Shield

This is the default json shield item + a text with the custom model data part

        },
        "thirdperson_lefthand": {

        },
        "firstperson_lefthand": {
            "rotation": [ 0, 180, 5 ],
            "translation": [ 10, 0, -10 ],
            "scale": [ 1.25, 1.25, 1.25 ]
        },
        "gui": {
            "rotation": [ 15, -25, -5 ],
            "translation": [ 2, 3, 0 ],
            "scale": [ 0.65, 0.65, 0.65 ]
        },
        "fixed": {
            "rotation": [ 0, 180, 0 ],
            "translation": [ -4.5, 4.5, -5],
            "scale":[ 0.55, 0.55, 0.55]
        },
        "ground": {
            "rotation": [ 0, 0, 0 ],
            "translation": [ 2, 4, 2],
            "scale":[ 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]
        }
    },
    "overrides": [
      {"predicate":
           {"blocking":1},
                "model": 
                    "item/shield_blocking"},
      {"predicate": 
          {"custom_model_data":2},
               "model": 
                   "item/shield/shield2"},
      {"predicate": 
          {"custom_model_data":2,
               "blocking":1},
                    "model": "item/shield/shield2_blocking"}
    ]
}

```

This will make the shield to apply the shield2 item state as default state with CustomModelData 2 and if its CustomModelData 2 and blocking, the shield2\_blocking item state will be applied.

shield2 and shield2\_blocking are json of items, you can either retexture the same shield or create one custom with external programs.
