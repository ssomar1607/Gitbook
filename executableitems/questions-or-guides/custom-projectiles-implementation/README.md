# Custom projectiles implementation

## Explanation

First of all, once you download the plugin, you have two jars, ExecutableItems + Score, there are a lots of tutorials and explanation for the first one, but.. what about Score?

Score is like the API of ExecutableItems but it also has the integration of projectiles, if want more information [<mark style="color:blue;">**Custom Projectiles**</mark>](../../../tools-for-all-plugins-score/custom-projectiles.md), in this case, we will see how to link them, so, let's do it:



{% content-ref url="creating-a-basic-projectile.md" %}
[creating-a-basic-projectile.md](creating-a-basic-projectile.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="launch-arrows-in-cone.md" %}
[launch-arrows-in-cone.md](launch-arrows-in-cone.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="launch-diamond-axe.md" %}
[launch-diamond-axe.md](launch-diamond-axe.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
