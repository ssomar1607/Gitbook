## Custom damage per projectile in the same item

In this tutorial I will directly explain how to add custom damages/actions on two different projectiles launched by your ExecutableItem. But you can do exactly the same only for one Custom Projectile.



* [x] Create 2 [Score projectiles](../../../tools-for-all-plugins-score/custom-projectiles.md) or more or less

Examples

{% code title="ROCKETBULLET.yml" %}
```yaml
type: DRAGON_FIREBALL
customName: RocketBullet
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="SNIPERBULLET.yml" %}
```yaml
type: ARROW
customName: SniperBullet
```
{% endcode %}

* [x] Then create your ExecutableItem
  * [x] Create two activators to LAUNCH your projectiles
  * [x] And create two others to run the custom damages/actions when the projectile hit something. In these activators you will need to verify the value of %projectile\_name% with a placeholder condition to run the good actions on the good projectile.

Example

{% code title="MyProjectilesLauncher" %}
```yaml

  activator_for_rocket:

    # around the player hit in radius of 5 blocks 
    # and it will display particles near all these place
    - AROUND distance:5 DAMAGE 10 <+> PARTICLE FIREWORKS_SPARK 10 0.1 0.5
    placeholdersConditions:
      plchCdt0:
        type: PLAYER_STRING
        comparator: EQUALS
        part1: '%projectile_name%'
        part2: RocketBullet
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Instead of only adding DAMAGE command you could add lot of things more, use AROUND command, or summon a lightning bolt, or use BURN command, give the target an effect, etc
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also use the activators PROJECTILE\_HIT\_BLOCK or PROJECTILE\_HIT\_ENTITY
