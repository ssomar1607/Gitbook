# Uploading texture pack

Well, first of all, I suggest to do this step once the **texture pack is done**, since if it isn't, you would need to upload it again and again with every change you made. Once this is said, let's start.

## Steps:

* First of all, get your texture pack, and zip it (for mac users, search videos on google how to do this)
* Then, go to this link: [https://mc-packs.net](https://mc-packs.net) (there are other ways, but this one is pretty good), and upload the resource pack there.

![Uploaded file](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (157).png>)

* Now press upload, and just wait. Once the process is done, the page will look like this:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (306).png>)

* The important part is the right side, where it says "Edit your server.properties file", so, we have to go there, it is in `serverfolder/server.properties`

*   Let's open it, and we have to search for:

    * resource-pack
    * resource-pack-sha1



![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (274).png>)

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (137).png>)

* And we just have to replace the values gave by the webpage into both of this.

* Once we have done that, let's save the file, and start your server

{% hint style="info" %}
If it was opened it is highly recommended to stop + start (don't restart but stop+restart)
{% endhint %}

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (242).png>)

And that's it, it is now in our server, I hope you understood everything if have a trouble in the process (and is not explained in this tutorial) feel free to ask in the discord of Ssomar plugins, have a nice day ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³
