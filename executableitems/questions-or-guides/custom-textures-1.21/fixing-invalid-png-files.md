# Fixing Invalid PNG Files

If you're confused to why your textures won't load despite being sure that the directories arae correct and blockbench is not complaining, then there's something wrong with your PNG file

To check, use an application like photoshop by opening it through photoshop. If it refuses to read the file, then there's really an issue to the png file.

To fix it, go to [https://cloudconvert.com/png-converter](https://cloudconvert.com/png-converter) and convert all of your "png" files to actual png files. Link your google account so it would automatically add it to your google drive to easily download a bulk of png files.
