# ⌨️ Commands & Permissions

{% hint style="info" %}
To give the permissions of all commands, I advice you to download a permission plugin like [**Luckperms**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/luckperms.28140/), once you have a perm plugin you just need to give the permission **`ec.*`**, for Luckperm the command is  <mark style="color:blue;">`/lp group default permission set ec.* true`</mark>
{% endhint %}

## Commands

#### Reload the plugin

* Command: **/ec reload**
* Permission: `ec.cmd.reload`

#### Open the GUI to create new ExecutableCraftings
