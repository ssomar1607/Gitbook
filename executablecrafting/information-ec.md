## Description&#x20;

ExecutableCrafting empowers Minecraft server owners to go beyond vanilla and create **fully customized, condition-based crafting recipes** with **zero coding required**. Add custom crafting, anvil, or furnace recipes, enforce player conditions, group recipes, and even build entire **interactive recipe books** â€” all using an intuitive interface and YAML configs.

Whether you're creating a hardcore RPG survival experience, a magic PvP server, or just want better control over your crafting system, **ExecutableCrafting is the plugin youâ€™ve been looking for**.
