# Free vs Premium

The free version of ExecutableCrafting is like a free-trial of it, to know how it works, what is possible and you could even make your whole server with it, but once you want to improve your recipes, and don't have all limitations the free one you have you start thinking into buying the premium version.. but, is it worth? what differences are there? couple of common questions asked in #support-ec in discord of Ssomar plugins, this page, should solve your answers.
