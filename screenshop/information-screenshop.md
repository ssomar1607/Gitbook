# ðŸ“Œ Information ScreenShop

## Description

ScreenShop is a plugin currently in development. I wanted to add Screen in Minecraft for fun so I developed this small plugin to see what is it possible to do. The plugin will probably be premium later. I just want to have feedbacks on this first version. If someone want help me to make clean design for the screen, contact me on discord.
