# 📃 Configurations

### Features

* Advanced AI Detection: Identifies 12 categories of harmful content including harassment, hate speech, threats, violence, and inappropriate sexual content FOR all languages.
* Customizable Confidence Levels: Fine-tune detection sensitivity for each category
* Flexible Response System: Configure unique responses for different violation types
* Real-time Moderation: Option to check messages before or after they're sent
* Comprehensive Logging: Track flagged messages in your server console
* Easy Configuration: Simple YAML file with detailed options

### Installation

Just drag and drop the plugin jar into your plugins folder and it is ready ! No need to create an OpenAI or MistralAI key. To not to leave any doubt, message may be cached in my programs for performance purpose only.

### How It Works

The plugin analyzes each chat message using AI technology to determine if it contains harmful content. When potentially harmful content is detected, the plugin can:

* Hide the message from other players
* Send warning messages to the offending player
* Execute custom commands based on the violation type
* Kick or take other administrative actions for severe violations

Give your moderators the tools they need to maintain a positive community without constantly monitoring chat. AI Chat Moderation works silently in the background, allowing you to focus on building and playing while keeping your server safe for everyone.
