# ðŸ”˜ Custom triggers

Custom trigger is a way to store commands and then run those commands with a simple command or schedule them.

It's available in ExecutableItems, ExecutableBlocks and ExecutableEvents.

To create a new CUSTOM\_TRIGGER:&#x20;

* [ ] Open the in-game editor
* [ ] Go on the object you want to edit.
* [ ] Add a new activator with the option CUSTOM\_TRIGGER
* [ ] (Optional) Edit the schedule features

<pre class="language-json"><code class="lang-json"><strong># Here are the Schedule formats
</strong><strong>scheduleFeatures:
</strong>    startDate: '1700-01-01 00:00:00' // Begin of the schedule
    endDate: '3000-01-01 00:00:00' // End of the schedule
    when:
    // Formats
    // Format 1 : {YEAR}:::{MONTH}:::{DAY}:::{HOUR}:::{MIN}:::{SEC}
    // Format 2 : {YEAR}:!:{WEEK}:!:{DAYSTRING}:!:{HOUR}:!:{MIN}:!:{SEC}
    // Examples :
    - '%%%%:::%%:::%%:::%%:::%%:::XX' // It runs every minute
    - '%%%%:::12:::[24,25,26]:::16:::XX:::XX' // It runs only the 24,25,26 December at 16 hours
    - '2024:::XX:::XX:::XX:::XX:::XX:::XX' // It runs the 1 January 2024 at 00:00:00
    - '%%%%:!:%%:!:MONDAY:!:14:!:XX:!:XX' // It runs every Monday at 14 hours
    - '%%%%:!:42:!:XX:!:[10,14,18]:!:XX:!:XX  // It runs at 10,14,18 hours everyday during the week 42
</code></pre>

If you want to trigger your custom trigger using a command it's very easy !

{% endhint %}

#### EB example

```
creationType: BASIC_CREATION
name: '&eMy epic block'
lore:
- '&b&oDefault lore'
material: STONE
dropType: IN_THE_INVENTORY
activators:
  my_drop_ei_trigger:
    name: '&eActivator'
    option: CUSTOM_TRIGGER
    commands:
    - DROPEXECUTABLEITEM the_reward_ei 100
    - AROUND 15 false SENDMESSAGE &7&oCheck your epic block, there is a &ebig reward
      &7for you !
