# ✔️ Compatible Plugins

{% hint style="info" %}
Take note that this list is strict related compatible plugins, almost every plugin is compatible with Ssomar plugins, if you want to run a command from another plugin, just replace the name of the target with the placeholders. \
\
For example essentials fly\
essentials:fly %player%\
\
For example vanish\
vanish %player%



For example essentials economy

economy give %player% 100\
\
Etcetera, **every command that supports the name of a player is "compatible" with EI |EB | EE.**
{% endhint %}

This section is for compatible plugins that works with Ssomar plugins, there are some features that we have that its compatible with the other plugins.

* Before starting you must know that compatible ≠ usable, allmost all plugins are usable for Ssomar Plugins, this is because all commands are run by the console, that means you can use your custom plugin's commands using the correct arguments. For example
  * Want to apply fly command from essentials to the player ?
    * essentials:fly %player%
  * Want to apply vanish command from essenntials to the player ?
    * vanish %player%
  * Want to give money from essentials economy to the player?
    * economy give %player% 100
  * And a big list, every command outside Ssomar plugin's world that supports a target where you can fill with %player% then it can be used.

### MythicMobs

#### You can make your MythicMobs mobs drop Ssomar Plugins Items in these ways:

*   ExecutableItems:

    1. Hold the ExecutableItem and do `/mm i import` , this will make the item to get imported into the items.yml file of MythicMobs, from there, you can add it to the LootTable of MythicMobs.
    2. Executing a skill \~onDeath from the mob, casting a command skill adding the next line:

    ```yaml
    Skills:
    - command{c="ei drop <item> 1 <caster.l.w> <caster.l.x> <caster.l.y> <caster.l.z>"} @self ~onDeath
    ```
* ExecutableBlocks:
  * The same idea but instead of using ExecutableItem use the ExecutableBlock, and on the command from skill use "eb" instead of "ei".

#### You can specify the activators from SsomarPlugins to only work with specific MythicMobs using the feature [detailedEntities](https://docs.ssomar.com/executableitems/configurations/activator-configuration/activators-features#p_e-detailedentities).

* Example : Creating an ExecutableItem that makes more damage to a list of MythicMobs
* Example: Creating an ExecutableBlock  that damages a specific MythicMob when it walks above the block
* Example: Creating an ExecutableEvent that only works for a list of MythicMobs.

#### You can summon MM Mobs using this command inside your activator:

* Depending on the activator you are using you may need to change the placeholders.
  * Example: Instead of %world% it may be needed to use %player\_world%,%target\_world% or %block\_world%

```yaml
activators:  
  activator1: # Activator ID, you can create as many activator on the activators list    
    commands:
    - mm m spawn {mob_id} 1 %world%,%x%,%y%,%z%
```

* ⭐You can use this idea with ExecutableBlocks and LOOP activator to create custom MythicMobs spawner.

#### Run MythicMobs skill from Ssomar Plugins features

* You can use on commands section  `SUDOOP mm test cast <skill>` to run a skill from MythicMobs.

#### Custom SCore commands

* [CHANGETOMYTHICMOB](https://docs.ssomar.com/tools-for-all-plugins-score/custom-commands/entity-commands#changetomythicmob)
  * ⭐Its possible to make a fishing system using MythicMobs like the one that is on the Hypixel Minecraft Server. For example having tier list of different fishing rods (All handled by ExecutableItems), that each tier will have from low probability to higher probability to catch more epic mobs from your lakes, adding restrictions to only fish MM mobs from the lakes in "x" cordinates (or a WorldGuard region), etc.

### **LevelledMobs**

* ExecutableItems
  * You can make your LevelledMobs drop ExecutableItems using this resource:
    * [https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/lm-items.102081/](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/lm-items.102081/)

### AureliumSkills

  * Also you can use AureliumSkills commands on your plugin, such as giving mana to the player, giving mana to the players around (Like a supporter), etc.
* ExecutableItems
  * Aurelium Skills NBT
    * You can create an ExecutableItem that while holding it increases your maximum mana, this can be done by creating an item, running the `/sk modifier` command and then while holding the item running `/ei create <id>` now the ExecutableItem has the NBTTag of the command and so it has the modifications that you made.

### ExecutableBlocks & ExecutableItems

* This two plugins (ExecutableBlocks and ExecutableItems) can get linked to each other. This link is made by the EB on the [TYPE\_OF\_CREATION ](https://docs.ssomar.com/executableblocks/configurations/block-configuration/block-features#creationtype)feature. For example:
  * Placing the ExecutableItem and it becomes the ExecutableBlock linked to it (by default it would lose the data of ExecutableItem and it would be placed as a vanilla block)
  * Breaking an ExecutableBlock and getting the ExecutableItem linked to it.
  * Tracking the same usage that the ExecutableBlock had placed when its broken and turned into the ExecutableItem linked and viceversa.
  * Tracking the same variable values that the ExecutableBlock had placed when its broken and turned into the ExecutableItem linked and viceversa.

### ItemsAdder

* ExecutableItems
  * You can use the textures created with ItemsAdder by using [customModelData ](https://docs.ssomar.com/executableitems/configurations/item-configuration/item-features#custom-model-data-1.14)feature or by using [item\_model](https://docs.ssomar.com/executableitems/configurations/item-configuration/item-features#itemmodel).
  *   You can link the ItemsAdder item into EI by following their wiki on how to link, its by adding the next line of code to the ItemsAdder item file.

      ```yaml
      executableitem:
        id: ZEUSCROWN
      ```
* ExecutableBlocks
  * You can create an ExecutableBlock with the texture of ItemsAdder block, this is done by selecting the [TYPE\_OF\_CREATION ](https://docs.ssomar.com/executableblocks/configurations/block-configuration/block-features#creationtype)feature of ExecutableBlocks.
* Its possible to select as [detailedBlocks ](https://docs.ssomar.com/executableitems/configurations/activator-configuration/activators-features#p_b-detailedblocks)for the activators related to a block of all plugins to select specific ItemsAdder blocks
  *   Example:

      ```yaml
      activators:  
        activator0: # Activator ID, you can create as many activator on the activators list    
          option: PLAYER_BLOCK_BREAK
          detailedBlocks:
          - ITEMSADDER:turquoise_block
      ```

### Nexo

* ExecutableItems
  * You can use the textures from Nexo inside your ExecutableItem just by using the [custom model data](https://docs.ssomar.com/executableitems/configurations/item-configuration/item-features#custom-model-data-1.14) value or the [item\_model](https://docs.ssomar.com/executableitems/configurations/item-configuration/item-features#itemmodel).

* All SCore commands are conditioned by WorldGuard protection
  * This means, a BREAK (SCore command) wont run if the player doesnt have permission to break a block at the selected position.
  * Keep in mind that this feature is on SCore commands, not on commands run by our plugins, this means using vanilla command inside one of our plugins "execute at %player% run setblock %block\_x% %block\_y% %block\_z% air replace" will bypass any restriction.
* ExecutableBlocks
  * You can fill a region with specific ExecutableBlock(s) with detailed weights by using [/eb wg-fill-region](https://docs.ssomar.com/executableblocks/commands-and-permissions#fill-a-worldguard-region-with-an-eb).

    *   The second way is by adding the NBT Tag manually on the ExecutableItems config file. Here is an example:

        ```yaml
        nbt:
          '0':
            key: ae_enchantment;haste # This add the haste AdvancedEnchantment NBT tag
            type: INT
