* When applying the particle cmd it needs 4 options more than the normal particles
  * \<R> \<G> \<B> \<Size>
  * Size is simple to know, is just the size of the particle, set it to 1 if don't know what to write
  * But R G B are sometimes hard to understand, since in the normal world the amount of each one is a number between 0 and 255, but in minecraft it is between 0 and 1, so you should make some conversions using math, calculator, etc.
* This link will help you to select the correct values to \<R> \<G> \<B>:
