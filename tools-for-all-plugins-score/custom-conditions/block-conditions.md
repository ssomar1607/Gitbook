# Block Conditions

{% hint style="info" %}
For conditions that require numerical values, you can assign 2 conditions.

Example: "I want to create a condition that only activates if the value is greater than 50 but less than 250"\
So what you would type in the config will be **`50 < CONDITION < 250`**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If a condition fails to be met, **you can enable cancelEvent** so if a specific condition isn't completed, cancelEvent will run.  You can also customize the error message !

You can also run commands if the condition has failed to execute!

Example:
{% endhint %}

```yaml
blockConditions:
     ifBlockAge: <2
     ifBlockAgeMsg: "héhéhé you can custom your message here"
     ifBlockAgeCancel: true
     ifBlockAgeCancelCmds:
     - say how sad
```

* Required: NO (Default: false)

### ifNoPlayerMustBeOnTheBlock

  * If the block you are clicking has a player on top of it, the activator doesn't activate
* Required: NO (Default: false)

### ifPlantFullyGrown - ifPlantNotFullyGrown

* Description: Checks if the target block is a fully grown plant.
* Example:

Q: What exactly is going on in placeholder conditions?\
A: The placeholder %var\_x% is being parsed according to the block in that position. Meaning, you can use this method to assign a specific number to insane amount of unique EBs without writing each id that may change overtime in blockTypeMustBe
