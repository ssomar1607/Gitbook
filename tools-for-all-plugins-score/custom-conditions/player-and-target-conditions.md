# Player & Target Conditions

{% hint style="info" %}
**INFO GIFS:** The activator used on the GIFS to demonstrate how each condition works is the LOOP activator, that why the error message of the condition appear mutiple times.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You want add player conditions ?

So in the activator part add playerConditions.

And obviously it's targetConditions for the condition of the target.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For conditions that require numerical values, you can assign 2 conditions.

Example: "I want to create a condition that only activates if the value is greater than 50 but less than 250"\
So what you would type in the config will be **`50 < CONDITION < 250`**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If a condition fails to be met, **you can enable cancelEvent** so if a specific condition isn't completed, cancelEvent will run.  You can also customize the error message !

Example:
{% endhint %}

```yaml
playerConditions:
    ifSneaking: true
    ifSneakingMsg: "&cMy custom error message here"
    ifSneakingCancel: true
```
