# Item Conditions

{% hint style="info" %}
For conditions that require numerical values, you can assign 2 conditions.

Example: "I want to create a condition that only activates if the value is greater than 50 but less than 250"\
So what you would type in the config will be **`50 < CONDITION < 250`**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If a condition fails to be met, **you can enable cancelEvent** so if a specific condition isn't completed, cancelEvent will run.  You can also customize the error message !

You can also run commands if the condition has failed to execute!

Example:
{% endhint %}

```yaml
itemConditions:
    ifDurability: '>600'
    ifDurabilityMsg: '' #<- Here is where you will add the custom message.
    ifDurabilityCancel: true
    ifDurabilityCmds:
    - say oh sympathy
