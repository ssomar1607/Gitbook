# âœ¨    SCore particles

## PAGE CREATION IN PROGRESS (it remains GIF and some examples to add)





{% embed url="https://youtu.be/_GavkHnQcvg?si=UaRm9LlUomDzoveQ" %}

Score includes many pre-made particles shapes from XParticle library and some custom other.&#x20;

## How to display the particles

The command to display the particle is `/score particles`

You will have to select a shape and configure correctly the command to achieve to do what you want.

### How to remove displayed particles

The command to clear displayed particles is `/score clear {player} PARTICLES`&#x20;



## General settings for all shapes

### Define the spawn point

To define where the shape will be displayed you have two choice, by mentioning directly the location or setting an entity UUID&#x20;

#### Using Player/Entity UUID

When you decide to use the entity UUID **the shape will follow en Player/Entity if he moves**. So it can deform the shape or make a cool effect.

```css
target:{uuid of the target}
/* Example using flat UUID */
target:b33183ad-e9c0-4d48-8eea-f8c9358d3568
/* Example using a placeholder */
target:%player_uuid%
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
You have to specify an UUID of a player or an entity. The player name doesn't work !
{% endhint %}

#### Using a specific location

Using location you are sure that the shape will not be deformed, it will stay static.

```css
location:{world},{x},{y},{z}
/* Example using flat location */
location:world,100,50,500
/* Example using placeholders */
location:%player_world%,%player_x%,%player_y%,%player_z%
```



### Particles definition

#### Particle type

Define the particle used by the shape. By default it will be the FLAME particle

```css
particle:{the particle type}
/* Example */
particle:CLOUD
```

List of particles available here: [List of Spigot particles ](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Particle.html)

#### Color

**Instead** of using `particle:{particle name}`  if you want to use REDSTONE / DUST particles you can directly use the setting color with a [custom color](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Color.html).

You can set two colors separated by a , to have a color transition.

```css
color:{color Name}
/* Example one color */
color:RED
/* Example two colors with transition */
color:AQUA,BLUE
```

#### Block particles

**Instead** of using `particle:{particle name}`  if you want to use BLOCK\_CRACK / BLOCK particles you can directly use the setting blockdata with a [material](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html).

```css
blockdata:{material}
/* Example */
blockdata:LAVA
```

#### Item particles

**Instead** of using `particle:{particle name}`  if you want to use ITEM\_CRACK/ ITEM particles you can directly use the setting itemstack with a [material](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html).

```css
itemstack:{material}
/* Example */
itemstack:DIAMOND_SHOVEL
```

### Offset / Shift the spawn point of the shape&#x20;

You can define an offset in a specific direction, it allows you for example to display the shape around the player / entity, without having to do complex calculation.

* offsetPitch: the pitch direction where the offset will be directed
* offsetYaw: the yaw direction where the offset will be directed
* offsetSitance: the distance of the offset
* offsetX: Increase the offset X location
* offsetY: Increase the offset Y location
* offsetZ: Increase the offset Z location

By default these settings are set to 0

```css
offsetPitch:{the pitch direction}
offsetYaw:{the yaw direction}
offsetDistance:{the distance}
offsetX:{x bonus}
offsetY:{y bonus}
offsetZ:{z bonus}
/* Example with flat values */
offsetPitch:0
offsetYaw:-90
offsetDistance:5
offsetY:-1
/* Example with placeholders */
offsetPitch:%player_pitch_initial%+30
offsetYaw:%player_yaw_initial%
offsetDistance:%var_myvar%
```
