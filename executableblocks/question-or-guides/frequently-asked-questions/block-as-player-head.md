# Block as player head

* If you'd like your ExecutableBlock to be a player head you need to first:
* Create an EI Item (ExecutableItem) /ei create \<id>
  * ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (346).png>)
  * Set the material to PLAYER\_HEAD
  * Use the features related to it to add a texture to it (link below)
  *

* And once the EI Item is ready, create your EB Block. And inside the MAIN GUI
* <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (374).png" alt="" data-size="original">
* On CreationType select IMPORT\_FROM\_EXECUTABLE\_ITEMS
* ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (365).png>)
* And select the EI you created
*

* Then save and that's it, now your EB is a custom texture PLAYER\_HEAD
