# Custom crafting

Commonly we receive questions related to Custom Crafting, Â¿Does ExecutableBlocks supports it?, well, the answer first of all is that ExecutableBlocks doesn't have a mechanic inside of it related to CustomCrafting, so you should download another plugin to achieve this.

We suggest you to use -> [<mark style="color:blue;">**CustomCrafting | Advanced Custom Recipe Plugin \[1.16 - 1.19 | Free\]**</mark>](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/customcrafting-advanced-custom-recipe-plugin-1-16-1-19-free.55883/)

## Discord

In case this didn't help you to achieve what you wanted or doesn't work for you, feel free to ask in the Discord of Ssomar plugins your question.
