# Players can't use the blocks

If its the case that you already make your blocks, and want to test with a player without op, without perms, they try and receive this message:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (75).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

That is because they don't have permissions to use the blocks, since nobody would like to give op to players, you have to give the correct permissions to your default players, for this, just check the section of [<mark style="color:blue;">**Permissions**</mark>](../../commands-and-permissions.md), and read the Tip on the top of the page ^^

In case this didn't help you to achieve what you wanted or doesn't work for you, feel free to ask in the Discord of Ssomar plugins your question.
