# Block Textures

To add custom blocks textures to an ExecutableBlock, you have one of this ways:

* Override a vanilla texture (this doesn't mean adding NEW block texture, this means, override a default one to create the one you want, that means, the default texture won't exist anymore, useful in case of worlds precreated where, for example, sponge block won't be used, you can edit it as you want, for example creating a machine, since nobody will get it and nobody will know its actually a sponge block retextured)
* Use Oraxen plugin
* Use ItemsAdder plugin
